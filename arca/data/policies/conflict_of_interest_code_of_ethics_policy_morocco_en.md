# Conflict of Interest and Code of Ethics Policy (Morocco)

> **General reference – Business ethics, integrity and duty of loyalty**  
> This policy is inspired by Moroccan legal principles on loyalty and good faith in employment and business, as well as international standards of ethics, integrity and professional conduct.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the rules relating to **conflicts of interest** and to set out the main principles of the Company’s **Code of Ethics**.  
It aims to ensure that decisions are made in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders, free from undue influence or personal gain.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All employees of the Company in Morocco, regardless of their role or contract type;  
- Managers, directors and members of governance bodies;  
- Interns, temporary workers and consultants who represent or act on behalf of the Company.

## 3. Definitions

1. **Conflict of interest**  
   A conflict of interest arises when an employee’s personal interests (financial, family, friendship, political, etc.) may influence or appear to influence the performance of their professional duties and the decisions they take on behalf of the Company.

2. **Personal interest**  
   Personal interest may include, for example:

   - Financial stakes in a client, supplier or competitor;  
   - Family or close personal relationships with persons working for or owning such entities;  
   - Secondary activities (paid or unpaid) that may interfere with the employee’s duties or compete with the Company’s activities;  
   - Any benefit or advantage that may compromise impartiality or objectivity.

3. **Code of Ethics**  
   The Code of Ethics groups together the core values and principles that guide the behaviour of employees: integrity, respect, confidentiality, responsibility, compliance with laws and protection of the Company’s reputation.

## 4. General ethical principles

The Company expects all employees to:

- Act with **integrity** and honesty in all professional situations;  
- Comply with applicable laws and regulations in Morocco and any other relevant jurisdiction;  
- Respect colleagues, clients, partners and third parties, avoiding any form of harassment or discrimination;  
- Protect the confidentiality of information and the security of Company assets;  
- Avoid situations of conflict of interest or, where such situations arise, **declare them without delay**.

## 5. Identification of conflicts of interest

Potential conflicts of interest may arise in particular when an employee:

- Participates in selecting or negotiating with a supplier in which they or a close relative have a financial stake;  
- Is involved in hiring or evaluating a family member or close friend;  
- Carries out a secondary professional activity that competes with the Company or uses Company resources for personal purposes;  
- Receives gifts, advantages or invitations from clients, suppliers or partners likely to influence their decisions.

Employees must remain vigilant and ask themselves whether:

- A reasonable third party could perceive a conflict between their personal interest and the Company’s interest;  
- Their personal situation may affect their impartiality or independence of judgment.

## 6. Obligation to declare conflicts of interest

- Any actual or potential conflict of interest must be **declared as soon as possible** to the employee’s line manager or to the relevant contact (HR, ethics/compliance officer, etc.).  
- The declaration should describe the situation, the persons involved and the possible impact on the employee’s duties.  
- The Company will then assess the situation and decide on the measures to be taken (for example, recusal from a decision, change of responsibilities, prohibition of certain activities).

Failure to declare a conflict of interest may itself constitute a breach of this policy, even if the situation did not lead to actual harm.

## 7. Management of conflicts of interest

Depending on the nature and severity of the conflict, the Company may implement one or more of the following measures:

- Excluding the employee from decision-making processes in which they are conflicted;  
- Reassigning certain tasks or responsibilities;  
- Prohibiting or limiting secondary activities that interfere with the employee’s duties;  
- Prohibiting business relationships with certain entities closely linked to the employee;  
- In serious cases, taking disciplinary action in accordance with internal rules and applicable law.

## 8. Secondary activities and external mandates

- Employees must ensure that any secondary activity (another job, business, consultancy, association mandate, etc.) does **not conflict** with the Company’s interests or their contractual obligations (working time, loyalty, confidentiality).  
- Some external activities (e.g. leadership roles in competing companies, high-exposure public mandates) may require prior written authorisation from the Company.  
- Employees must not use Company resources (time, equipment, information) for personal or external professional activities, unless expressly authorised.

## 9. Confidentiality and use of information

- Employees must not use confidential or strategic information obtained in the course of their duties for personal gain or for the benefit of third parties.  
- Confidential information must not be disclosed outside the Company, except where authorised or required by law.  
- The duty of confidentiality continues after the termination of the employment relationship, within the limits of applicable law.

## 10. Gifts, invitations and advantages

- Rules on gifts and invitations are detailed in the **Anti-Corruption, Gifts and Hospitality Policy**.  
- Employees must ensure that accepting or offering a gift or invitation does not create or reinforce a conflict of interest.  
- Any advantage received that could give rise to a conflict must be declared and, if necessary, refused or returned.

## 11. Reporting concerns and protection against retaliation

- Employees who have doubts about a potential conflict of interest or ethical issue are encouraged to seek advice from their manager, HR or the ethics/compliance contact.  
- Any suspected breach of this policy may be reported through the defined channels.  
- Reports made **in good faith** must not give rise to reprisals. The Company undertakes to protect whistleblowers within the limits of applicable law.

## 12. Sanctions

Breaches of this Conflict of Interest and Code of Ethics Policy may lead to disciplinary measures, which may include:

- Warning or formal reprimand;  
- Suspension or modification of duties;  
- Termination of the employment contract where justified;  
- Termination of contractual relations with external parties in serious cases.

Sanctions are applied in accordance with the Company’s procedures and Moroccan labour law.

## 13. Training and awareness

- The Company may organise training and awareness sessions on ethics, conflicts of interest and professional conduct.  
- Managers are encouraged to regularly discuss ethical issues with their teams and to promote an open environment where questions can be raised without fear.

## 14. Review of the policy

This Conflict of Interest and Code of Ethics Policy is reviewed periodically and, in particular, when:

- There are changes in legislation or regulatory expectations;  
- The Company’s activities or structure evolve significantly;  
- Incidents or feedback highlight areas requiring clarification or improvement.

In the event of conflict between this policy and mandatory legal provisions, **the legal requirements shall prevail**, and the policy shall be updated accordingly.
