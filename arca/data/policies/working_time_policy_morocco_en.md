# Working Time Policy (Morocco)

> **General reference – Working time and rest periods in Morocco**  
> This policy is inspired by the general principles of Moroccan labour law on working time, daily and weekly limits, and rest periods.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the internal rules on working time for employees of the Company established in Morocco.  
It aims to ensure compliance with applicable legislation and to provide clear guidance to managers and employees on schedules, breaks and overtime.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees working for the Company in Morocco under an employment contract in non-agricultural activities.  
Certain categories of workers (interns, temporary staff, young workers, night workers, etc.) may be subject to additional legal protections or specific internal rules.

## 3. Normal working time

1. **Weekly duration**  
   - The Company sets the normal working time at **40 hours per week** for full-time employees, in line with common practice and within the legal framework applicable in Morocco.  
   - Working time is generally distributed over **five (5) days**, from Monday to Friday.

2. **Daily schedule**  
   - The standard working schedule is:  
     - **Monday to Friday, from 9:00 to 17:00**.  
   - This schedule includes a daily break (for example for lunch), the exact duration and paid or unpaid nature of which are specified in internal rules or any applicable collective agreement.

3. **Recording of working time**  
   - Managers must ensure that working time is recorded using the system chosen by the Company (badge, timesheet, digital tool, etc.).  
   - Any anomaly or inconsistency in time records must be investigated and corrected without undue delay.

## 4. Breaks and rest periods

1. **Daily breaks**  
   - When daily working time exceeds six hours, employees are entitled to at least one break to rest and take meals.  
   - The minimum duration of breaks and whether they are paid or unpaid are defined by internal rules or, where applicable, by collective agreements.

2. **Weekly rest**  
   - Employees are entitled to a **weekly rest period of at least 24 consecutive hours**, usually taken on Saturday or Sunday or in accordance with local practice, in line with Moroccan labour law.

## 5. Overtime

1. **Exceptional nature of overtime**  
   - Overtime must remain **exceptional** and be justified by operational needs (work peaks, specific projects, replacement, etc.).  
   - Systematic or permanent overtime must lead to a review of staffing levels or work organisation.

2. **Prior authorisation**  
   - Overtime must be **approved in advance** by the line manager and, where required, by HR.  
   - Unauthorised overtime may be refused or not compensated, subject to legal obligations imposed on the employer.

3. **Limits and compensation**  
   - The total overtime performed by an employee must comply with the limits set by Moroccan labour legislation.  
   - Overtime is compensated in accordance with applicable legal and/or collective agreement provisions, particularly for night work, work on weekly rest days or public holidays.

## 6. Night work and special cases

- Night work, work on weekly rest days and work on public holidays are subject to specific legal rules (compensation, maximum duration, health and safety measures).  
- The Company applies any additional protections required by law for vulnerable categories of workers (e.g. young workers, pregnant or breastfeeding women).

## 7. Responsibilities

- **Management** is responsible for organising working time in compliance with this policy and legal requirements, and for monitoring working hours within their teams.  
- **HR** is responsible for updating this policy when legislation changes and for providing guidance, information and training to managers and employees.  
- **Employees** must comply with their assigned working schedules, record their working time honestly and report any situation likely to exceed legal limits.

## 8. Compliance and review

This policy is based on general provisions of Moroccan labour law relating to working time and rest periods.  
In the event of any contradiction between this policy and binding legal rules, **the legal rules shall prevail**.  
The policy is reviewed at least once a year, or more frequently in the event of significant legislative changes or major changes in the Company’s organisation.
