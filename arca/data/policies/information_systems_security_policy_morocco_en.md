# Information Systems Security Policy (Morocco)

> **General reference – Information security and data protection**  
> This policy is inspired by recognised best practices in information security (for example the principles of ISO 27001) and by Moroccan requirements relating to the protection of personal data and the confidentiality of professional information.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the rules and principles of security applicable to the Company’s information systems (IS), in order to:

- Protect the **confidentiality**, **integrity** and **availability** of information;  
- Comply with legal and contractual obligations (personal data protection, professional secrecy, confidentiality clauses, etc.);  
- Reduce the risk of data leaks, fraud, loss of information and service interruption.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All users of the information systems: employees, interns, service providers, consultants, etc.;  
- All IT assets: workstations, laptops, servers, networks, applications, databases, mobile devices, collaboration tools, etc.;  
- All data processed by the Company (client data, employee data, supplier data, financial, technical and strategic information, etc.).

## 3. Access management

1. **Individual accounts**  
   - Each user is assigned a **personal and unique** user account to access the Company’s information systems.  
   - Sharing accounts or passwords between users is strictly **prohibited**.

2. **Passwords**  
   - Passwords must meet minimum **complexity requirements** (length, mix of characters, etc.) defined by the Company’s security rules.  
   - They must be changed regularly and must **never be reused** for personal services.  
   - Users must keep their passwords confidential and must not write them down in an unsecured manner.

3. **Access rights**  
   - Access rights are granted based on the **principle of least privilege**: each user receives only the permissions necessary to perform their job.  
   - Rights are reviewed regularly, especially in the event of a change of role or departure from the Company, and are adjusted or revoked without undue delay.

## 4. Workstations and mobile devices

- Workstations must be **locked** when left unattended, even for short periods.  
- Users are not allowed to install software not authorised by the IT department.  
- Laptops, smartphones and tablets used for work must be protected by a password, PIN or other secure authentication mechanism.  
- In the event of **loss or theft** of a device, the user must immediately inform IT or their manager so that appropriate measures can be taken (blocking, remote wipe, password changes, etc.).

## 5. Use of internet, email and collaboration tools

- Internet access and the use of email and collaboration tools (chat, videoconferencing, file sharing, etc.) are primarily for **professional purposes**.  
- Users must not access or distribute illegal, offensive, discriminatory or inappropriate content via Company systems.  
- Suspicious emails (phishing, scams, attachments or links from unknown sources) must not be opened and should be reported to IT support or the security contact.  
- Documents containing sensitive information must only be shared via channels authorised by the Company (internal platforms, secure file-sharing tools, etc.).

## 6. Protection against malware and vulnerabilities

- All workstations and servers must have an **antivirus** or approved security solution installed and kept up to date.  
- Security updates for operating systems and applications must be applied within reasonable timeframes to reduce vulnerabilities.  
- Downloading or using software from untrusted sites or sources is prohibited.

## 7. Backup and business continuity

- Critical data must be subject to **regular backups**, and restoration tests must be carried out periodically to ensure their effectiveness.  
- Business Continuity Plans (BCP) and/or Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) must be defined for essential systems, taking into account various risk scenarios (technical failures, cyberattacks, natural disasters, etc.).

## 8. Security incidents

1. **Reporting**  
   - Any incident or suspicion of an information security incident (suspicious email, abnormal system behaviour, unauthorised access, potential data leak, etc.) must be reported **immediately** to IT support or the information security contact.

2. **Management and follow-up**  
   - Incidents are recorded, analysed and dealt with according to internal procedures.  
   - Corrective and preventive measures may be implemented (reinforcement of controls, updates to systems, changes to procedures, awareness campaigns, etc.).

## 9. Awareness and training

- The Company organises, where possible, **awareness and training activities** on information security (internal campaigns, e-learning modules, workshops, etc.).  
- Users are encouraged to adopt cautious behaviour and to seek advice if they have doubts about an email, link, file or request concerning access or data.

## 10. Responsibilities

- **Top management** is responsible for validating the information security strategy and for allocating the necessary resources (human, technical, financial).  
- **IT and security teams** implement technical measures, manage access, monitor systems and handle incidents.  
- **Managers** are responsible for ensuring that security rules are followed within their teams and for reminding employees about them when necessary.  
- **Each user** is personally responsible for the proper and secure use of systems and information resources made available to them.

## 11. Review of the policy

This Information Systems Security Policy is reviewed regularly (at least once a year) or following major events, such as:

- Changes in the legal or regulatory framework applicable in Morocco;  
- Deployment of new systems or significant technological changes;  
- Occurrence of serious or repeated information security incidents.

In the event of conflict between this policy and mandatory legal provisions, **the legal requirements shall prevail**, and the policy shall be updated accordingly.
