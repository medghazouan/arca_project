# Telework and Hybrid Work Policy (Morocco)

> **General reference – Organisation of work and labour law in Morocco**  
> This policy is inspired by Moroccan labour law principles and international best practices on telework, employee protection, and work-life balance.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the conditions and rules applicable to **telework** and **hybrid work** arrangements within the Company in Morocco.  
It aims to ensure that telework is organised in a way that preserves productivity, protects employees’ rights and health, and maintains information security and service quality.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- Employees whose position and tasks are compatible with telework (full or partial);  
- Telework carried out from the employee’s home or from another location previously authorised by the Company;  
- Hybrid work arrangements combining days at the office and days working remotely.

Telework is not a right for all positions; eligibility depends on operational needs, the nature of the job and management decisions.

## 3. Definitions

- **Telework**: work that could be performed on Company premises but is carried out remotely, on a regular or occasional basis, using IT tools and communication technologies.  
- **Hybrid work**: a mode of organisation in which the employee alternates between working on Company premises and teleworking, according to an agreed schedule.

## 4. Eligibility and implementation

1. **Eligibility criteria**  
   - The position must be compatible with remote work (tasks that can be performed without continuous physical presence on site).  
   - The employee must have demonstrated autonomy, reliability and respect for deadlines and procedures.  
   - Telework must not jeopardise the proper functioning of the team, the quality of service or client relations.

2. **Decision-making and agreement**  
   - The implementation of telework or hybrid work requires the **agreement of the Company** and the **employee**.  
   - The arrangements (number of days teleworked per week, working hours, place of work, duration of the arrangement, conditions for review) are defined in writing (addendum to the contract, internal agreement, or email confirmation).

## 5. Working time and availability

- The **working time** of teleworking employees remains the same as that applicable on Company premises, in accordance with Moroccan labour law and Company rules.  
- Teleworking employees must be **reachable and available** during agreed working hours (phone, email, collaboration tools).  
- Breaks and rest periods must be respected, and overtime must be requested and approved under the same conditions as on-site work.

## 6. Place of telework and working conditions

- As a general rule, telework is carried out at the employee’s home or at another location previously agreed with the Company.  
- The chosen place must offer appropriate conditions in terms of:  
  - Internet connectivity;  
  - Confidentiality of professional conversations;  
  - Security and stability of the work environment.  
- The employee is responsible for organising their workspace so that it is comfortable and compatible with their health and safety (ergonomics, lighting, posture, etc.).

## 7. Equipment and costs

- The Company may provide the necessary equipment for telework (laptop, screen, headset, etc.), in accordance with its internal rules and inventory procedures.  
- The employee must take care of the provided equipment and use it only for professional purposes, unless otherwise authorised.  
- The rules regarding reimbursement of certain costs (internet, phone, etc.) are defined by the Company where applicable and communicated to employees concerned.

## 8. Data protection and information security

- Teleworking employees must comply with all **IT security** and **data protection** rules (passwords, encryption, access control, acceptable use policy, etc.).  
- Sensitive or confidential documents must not be left unattended or accessible to third parties at the telework location.  
- When connecting from outside, employees must use secure methods (VPN or other solutions approved by the Company).  
- Any incident (loss or theft of equipment, suspicion of hacking, sending sensitive information to the wrong recipient, etc.) must be reported immediately to IT support or the security contact.

## 9. Supervision, performance and communication

- Telework must not lead to isolation. Managers and teams must maintain regular contact (virtual meetings, calls, messages, etc.).  
- The evaluation of performance is based on the achievement of objectives, quality of work and respect for deadlines, under the same principles as on-site work.  
- The Company may use tools to monitor activity (connection to systems, use of certain applications, etc.) in a manner proportionate to the objective, in compliance with applicable law and with prior information to employees.

## 10. Health, safety and well-being

- The Company remains committed to protecting the health and safety of teleworking employees.  
- Employees are encouraged to:  
  - Organise their working day with regular breaks;  
  - Maintain a healthy separation between work time and personal time;  
  - Inform their manager if they feel an impact on their health due to telework conditions.  
- Where possible, the Company may provide guidelines on ergonomics and good telework practices.

## 11. Return to full on-site work and changes to arrangements

- Telework or hybrid work arrangements may be **reviewed or suspended** by the Company in the event of organisational changes, performance issues, security needs or other legitimate reasons.  
- Any significant modification to telework arrangements (increase or reduction of remote days, change of telework location, etc.) must be discussed and confirmed in writing.

## 12. Review of the policy

This Telework and Hybrid Work Policy is reviewed periodically and in particular when:

- There are changes in applicable legal or regulatory frameworks in Morocco;  
- There are major changes in the Company’s organisation or in telework technologies;  
- Feedback from employees or operational experience highlights the need for adjustments.

In the event of conflict between this policy and mandatory legal provisions, **the legal requirements shall prevail**, and the policy shall be updated accordingly.
