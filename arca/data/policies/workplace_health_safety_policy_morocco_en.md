# Workplace Health and Safety Policy (Morocco)

> **General reference – Occupational health and safety in Morocco**  
> This policy is inspired by Moroccan labour law requirements on health and safety at work, as well as international best practices in occupational risk prevention.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the principles and rules adopted by the Company to ensure the health and safety of all employees and other persons present on its premises or working on its behalf in Morocco.  
The Company is committed to providing a safe and healthy working environment and to preventing accidents at work and occupational diseases as far as reasonably practicable.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All employees of the Company in Morocco, regardless of their position or contract type;  
- Interns, temporary workers, service providers and visitors present on Company premises or sites;  
- All workplaces, including offices, production sites, warehouses, and any location where work is carried out for the Company.

## 3. General principles

The Company undertakes to:

- Comply with applicable occupational health and safety laws and regulations in Morocco;  
- Identify, assess and manage occupational risks in a systematic manner;  
- Implement preventive and protective measures adapted to the nature of the activities;  
- Provide appropriate information, training and awareness-raising for employees;  
- Promote a safety culture in which each person contributes to risk prevention.

## 4. Risk assessment and prevention measures

1. **Risk assessment**  
   - The Company regularly evaluates risks to the health and safety of employees (physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic, psychosocial risks, etc.).  
   - This assessment takes into account the specificities of each workplace and each job.

2. **Preventive measures**  
   Depending on the risks identified, the Company may implement, in particular:

   - **Technical measures**: appropriate equipment, guards, ventilation, signage, safety devices, etc.;  
   - **Organisational measures**: work procedures, rotation of tasks, limitation of exposure times, emergency plans;  
   - **Personal protective equipment (PPE)**: helmets, gloves, safety shoes, masks, hearing protection, etc., provided and maintained by the Company when required.

## 5. Information, training and awareness

- Employees receive information and, where necessary, training on the risks associated with their activities and on the safety measures to be implemented.  
- Specific training is provided for certain high‑risk tasks (handling of chemicals, use of machines, work at height, etc.).  
- Regular awareness campaigns may be organised (posters, emails, toolbox talks, safety days) to reinforce good practices.

## 6. Workstations and ergonomics

- The Company strives to adapt workstations to the physical capabilities of employees in order to limit the risks of musculoskeletal disorders and fatigue.  
- For office work, particular attention is paid to seating, screen height, lighting and breaks.  
- Employees are encouraged to report any discomfort or pain that may be related to their workstation so that adjustments can be considered.

## 7. Emergency situations and first aid

- Emergency procedures are defined and communicated (fire, evacuation, accident, medical emergency, etc.).  
- Evacuation routes and emergency exits must remain unobstructed and clearly marked.  
- First‑aid equipment is available and maintained (first‑aid kits, possibly defibrillators).  
- Where possible, certain employees are designated and trained as first‑aiders or emergency coordinators.

## 8. Reporting and management of incidents and accidents

1. **Reporting**  
   - Any accident at work, dangerous situation, near‑miss or incident affecting health or safety must be reported without delay to the line manager or the health and safety contact.  

2. **Investigation and corrective actions**  
   - Reported events are analysed in order to identify root causes and to implement corrective and preventive measures.  
   - Lessons learned are shared, as appropriate, with employees concerned to avoid recurrence.

## 9. Roles and responsibilities

- **Top management** ensures that health and safety are integrated into the Company’s strategy and that adequate resources are allocated (human, technical, financial).  
- **Managers** are responsible for applying this policy in their teams, monitoring working conditions and correcting unsafe situations.  
- **The health and safety function or designated persons** (where applicable) support the implementation of preventive measures, risk assessments and awareness actions.  
- **Employees** must:  
  - Comply with safety instructions and procedures;  
  - Use personal protective equipment correctly;  
  - Report any situation they consider dangerous or any health and safety incident;  
  - Take care of their own health and safety and that of others affected by their actions at work.

## 10. Cooperation with external parties

- When contractors or service providers work on Company sites, they must comply with this policy and with the specific safety instructions applicable to the site.  
- The Company ensures that health and safety requirements are taken into account in contracts with external partners.

## 11. Monitoring and continuous improvement

- Health and safety performance may be monitored using indicators (number of accidents, near‑misses, training sessions, etc.).  
- The Company seeks to continuously improve its health and safety management system by taking into account feedback from employees, audits and inspections, regulatory changes and technological developments.

## 12. Review of the policy

This Workplace Health and Safety Policy is reviewed periodically (at least once a year) and in particular when:

- There are significant changes in Moroccan regulations relating to health and safety at work;  
- There are major changes in activities, processes or work equipment;  
- Serious or repeated accidents or incidents occur.

In the event of any conflict between this policy and mandatory legal provisions, **the legal requirements shall prevail**, and the policy shall be adapted accordingly.
