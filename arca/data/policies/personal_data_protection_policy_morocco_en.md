# Personal Data Protection Policy (Morocco)

> **General reference – Personal data protection in Morocco**  
> This policy is inspired by the principles of Moroccan regulations on the protection of personal data (CNDP) and international best practices (lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality).

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the rules applied by the Company to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and protection of personal data processed in the context of its activities in Morocco.  
It aims to ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements and to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All **personal data** processed by the Company in Morocco, regardless of the medium or system used (paper or electronic);
- All processing operations carried out on personal data (collection, recording, organisation, storage, use, transmission, archiving, deletion, etc.);
- All employees, interns, temporary workers and service providers who process personal data on behalf of the Company.

## 3. Definitions

For the purposes of this policy:

- **Personal data** means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (for example: name, ID number, contact details, online identifiers, etc.);
- **Processing** means any operation performed on personal data (collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure, erasure, destruction, etc.);
- **Data subject** means any natural person whose personal data is processed;
- **Controller** means the Company that determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.

## 4. Core principles

The Company undertakes to respect the following principles:

1. **Lawfulness and fairness**  
   - Personal data are processed lawfully and fairly.  
   - Whenever required, consent is obtained in a clear and informed manner.

2. **Purpose limitation**  
   - Data are collected for **specific, explicit and legitimate purposes**, and are not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes.

3. **Data minimisation**  
   - Only data that are **adequate, relevant and limited** to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of the processing are collected.

4. **Accuracy**  
   - Data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.  
   - Inaccurate data are rectified or erased without undue delay.

5. **Storage limitation**  
   - Data are kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects **no longer than necessary** for the purposes for which they are processed (see Data Retention Policy).

6. **Integrity and confidentiality**  
   - Appropriate technical and organisational measures are implemented to protect data against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage.

## 5. Legal bases for processing

Personal data may be processed by the Company on one or more of the following legal bases, depending on the situation:

- Consent of the data subject;
- Performance of a contract or pre-contractual measures;
- Compliance with a legal obligation;
- Legitimate interests pursued by the Company, provided that they do not override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.

## 6. Categories of data processed

Depending on the business activities, the Company may process in particular:

- Identification and contact data (name, address, telephone, email, ID number, etc.);
- Professional data (position, department, employer, work history, evaluations);
- Financial and transactional data (bank details, payments, invoices);
- Technical data (connection logs, IP address, device identifiers) when required for security or service provision;
- Any other category of data strictly necessary for the purposes declared to the competent authorities, where applicable.

Special categories of data (for example health data) are processed only under strict conditions and subject to reinforced safeguards.

## 7. Information and rights of data subjects

The Company informs data subjects, in a clear and accessible manner, about:

- The identity of the controller and, where applicable, its representative or data protection contact;
- The purposes of the processing and its legal basis;
- The categories of data collected;
- The recipients or categories of recipients of the data;
- The retention period or the criteria used to determine it;
- The rights of the data subjects and how to exercise them.

Data subjects may, in accordance with applicable law, exercise the following rights:

- Right of access;
- Right to rectification;
- Right to erasure (right to be forgotten), subject to legal obligations to retain certain data;
- Right to object to or restrict processing in certain cases;
- Right to portability where the conditions are met.

Requests relating to these rights must be handled within reasonable timeframes and in accordance with legal requirements.

## 8. Data security

The Company implements technical and organisational measures appropriate to the risks, including but not limited to:

- Access control and authentication mechanisms;
- Logs and monitoring for security purposes;
- Encryption of data in transit and/or at rest where appropriate;
- Regular backups and continuity plans;
- Awareness and training for employees on data protection and security.

Any security incident likely to affect personal data (loss, unauthorised access, disclosure, modification, destruction, etc.) must be reported without delay to the relevant internal contact so that appropriate measures can be taken.

## 9. Transfers of data

If personal data are transferred outside Morocco or communicated to third parties (subsidiaries, partners, service providers), the Company ensures that:

- The recipients offer adequate guarantees of security and confidentiality;
- Appropriate contractual clauses or mechanisms are in place;
- The transfer complies with the requirements imposed by the competent authorities.

## 10. Processors and third parties

When the Company uses third-party service providers that process personal data on its behalf (processors), it ensures that:

- A written contract is in place, defining the subject-matter, duration, nature and purpose of the processing, the types of personal data and the categories of data subjects;
- The processor is bound by obligations of confidentiality and security at least equivalent to those of the Company;
- The processor does not engage another processor without prior authorisation and under similar conditions.

## 11. Governance and responsibilities

- **Top management** validates this policy and ensures that adequate resources are allocated to implement it.  
- Where applicable, a **data protection officer or compliance function** advises on the application of data protection rules and acts as a point of contact with the authorities.  
- **Managers** ensure that the policy is applied within their teams and that staff are aware of their obligations.  
- **All employees and users** who have access to personal data must comply with this policy and the related procedures.

## 12. Review of the policy

This Personal Data Protection Policy is reviewed at least once a year and whenever there is:

- A significant change in the applicable regulations in Morocco or in the recommendations of the competent authorities;  
- A major change in the Company’s activities or in the technologies used;  
- A serious incident or a finding of non-compliance relating to the protection of personal data.

In case of conflict between this policy and mandatory legal provisions, **the legal rules shall prevail**, and the policy shall be amended accordingly.
