# Data Retention Policy (Morocco)

> **General reference – Personal data protection and record-keeping in Morocco**  
> This policy is inspired by Moroccan regulations on the protection of personal data (CNDP) and general legal obligations relating to the retention of business records, as well as international best practices (data minimisation, storage limitation and security).

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the rules applicable to the **retention**, **archiving** and **deletion** of data collected and processed by the Company.  
It aims to ensure that data are not kept longer than necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected, in line with the principle of **storage limitation**.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All **personal data** processed by the Company (clients, prospects, employees, candidates, suppliers, etc.);  
- All **business data** related to the Company’s activities (contractual, commercial, financial, technical data, etc.);  
- All media and systems used to store data: information systems, databases, paper archives, backups, mobile devices, etc.

## 3. General principles of data retention

1. **Limited duration**  
   - Data are kept for a period **strictly necessary** for the purposes for which they were collected.  
   - Once these purposes have been fulfilled, data must be either **securely deleted** or **anonymised**, so that the individuals concerned can no longer be identified.

2. **Legal basis and obligations**  
   - Retention periods take into account:  
     - Legal or regulatory requirements (tax, social, commercial obligations, etc.);  
     - Limitation periods (for example, to defend the Company in case of legal claims);  
     - Legitimate operational needs of the Company.

3. **Data minimisation**  
   - The Company strives to minimise the volume of retained data: only information that is relevant and necessary for the defined purposes is kept.

## 4. Indicative retention periods

The following periods are given for guidance and must be adapted to the Company’s activities and applicable laws:

- **Client data**:  
  - For the duration of the contractual relationship, then generally up to **5 years** after its end, unless a longer legal period applies.  

- **Prospect data**:  
  - Up to **3 years** after the last active contact with the person (request for information, commercial interaction, etc.).  

- **Candidate (recruitment) data**:  
  - Generally up to **2 years** after the last contact if the candidate is not hired, to allow the Company to recontact them for other opportunities (unless they object).  

- **Employee data**:  
  - For the duration of the employment contract, then for additional periods as required by law (for example, payroll or social security documents may need to be kept for several years).  

- **Supplier and service provider data**:  
  - For the duration of the contractual relationship, then in accordance with commercial and tax limitation periods.  

- **Technical and security logs**:  
  - Usually between **6 and 12 months**, depending on security needs and regulatory requirements.

## 5. Archiving and deletion

1. **Intermediate archiving**  
   - Certain data may be kept in **intermediate archiving** when they still have legal, administrative or evidentiary value (for example, in view of potential litigation).  
   - Such data are stored in a secure environment with restricted access.

2. **Deletion or anonymisation**  
   - At the end of the retention period, data must be:  
     - **Erased** from systems and databases in a secure and irreversible manner; or  
     - **Anonymised**, i.e. transformed so that individuals can no longer be identified.

3. **Traceability**  
   - Where possible, deletion or anonymisation operations are documented (logs, reports) to demonstrate that this policy has been correctly applied.

## 6. Security of retained data

- Throughout the retention period, data must be protected by appropriate security measures (access controls, encryption where necessary, backups, etc.).  
- Access to data is limited to persons whose functions require such access, in accordance with the **need-to-know** principle.

## 7. Rights of data subjects

- Data subjects may exercise their rights (access, rectification, erasure, objection, etc.) in accordance with Moroccan regulations on personal data protection.  
- Where the law so requires, requests for deletion must be honoured, unless the Company is legally obliged to retain certain data for a longer period (for example for tax or legal reasons).

## 8. Responsibilities

- **Top management** approves this policy and ensures that the necessary resources are available to implement it.  
- The **data protection or compliance function**, where it exists, provides advice on retention periods and legal obligations.  
- **Business owners and IT teams** are responsible for applying the policy within their processes and systems by defining concrete retention rules, archiving practices and deletion procedures.

## 9. Review of the policy

This Data Retention Policy is reviewed at least once a year, or more frequently where:

- There are significant changes in Moroccan regulations or CNDP recommendations;  
- The Company’s activities or technologies evolve in a way that affects data retention practices;  
- Incidents or non-compliance related to retention periods are identified.

In the event of conflict between this policy and mandatory legal provisions, **the legal rules shall prevail**, and the policy shall be amended accordingly.
