      "divergence_summary": "The internal policy's general data retention principles do not address specific customer deletion requests or the mandatory 30-day deletion timeline required by the new regulation.",
      "conflicting_policy_excerpt": "Data are kept for a period strictly necessary for the purposes for which they were collected. Once these purposes have been fulfilled, data must be either securely deleted or anonymised...",
      "new_rule_excerpt": "All personal customer data must be permanently deleted within 30 days of receiving a deletion request from the customer.",

      "severity": "HIGH",
      "divergence_summary": "The internal policy permits anonymization as an alternative to erasure, which directly conflicts with the regulation's mandate for permanent deletion of personal customer data upon a deletion request.",
      "conflicting_policy_excerpt": "Anonymised, i.e. transformed so that individuals can no longer be identified.",
      "new_rule_excerpt": "All personal customer data must be permanently deleted within 30 days of receiving a deletion request from the customer.",
      "recommendation": "Update the policy to explicitly state that personal customer data subject to a deletion request must be permanently deleted, not merely anonymized, and to incorporate all other requirements of Article 12."

      "severity": "HIGH",
      "divergence_summary": "The internal policy's logging requirement is conditional ('where possible') and lacks a specific retention period, directly conflicting with the regulation's mandatory 5-year log retention.",
      "conflicting_policy_excerpt": "Where possible, deletion or anonymisation operations are documented (logs, reports) to demonstrate that this policy has been correctly applied.",
      "new_rule_excerpt": "Deletion logs must be maintained for audit purposes for a minimum period of 5 years.",
      "recommendation": "Update Policy 3. Traceability to mandate deletion log maintenance for a minimum of 5 years, removing the 'where possible' clause, and address all other missing requirements from Article 12."

      "conflicting_policy_excerpt": "Technical and security logs: Usually between 6 and 12 months, depending on security needs and regulatory requirements.",
      "new_rule_excerpt": "Deletion logs must be maintained for audit purposes for a minimum period of 5 years.",

      "conflicting_policy_excerpt": "requests for deletion must be honoured, unless the Company is legally obliged to retain certain data for a longer period (for example for tax or legal reasons).",
      "new_rule_excerpt": "All personal customer data must be permanently deleted within 30 days of receiving a deletion request from the customer.",
      "recommendation": "Revise the policy to align deletion timelines and exceptions strictly with Article 12, ensuring no data is retained beyond 30 days post-request unless explicitly permitted by the new regulation."
